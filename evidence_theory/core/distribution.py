    A subclass of dict designed to store evidence data where keys are instances of the Item class,

    Methods:
        __init__(*args, **kwargs): Initializes the Evidence dictionary, validating that keys are
                                   instances of Item and values are floats.

                                 instance of Item and the value is a float.

        __getitem__(item): Retrieves an item from the dictionary, ensuring that the key is an
                           instance of Item.
